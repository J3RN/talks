# J3RN's Talks

This is a collection of [J3RN](http://j3rn.com)'s talks, in the best format that they can be recreated. Naturally, many of them are missing.

## Here's what we do have

| Talk                              | Description                                                                               | How to run |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [Intro to Angular](angular-talk/) | It's not bad, I promise! Whenever two Vim panes appear side-by-side, I would re-write what's on the right into the left pane, explaining it as I went. It's magical! | `./talk.sh` |
| [BBC Talk](bbc_talk/)             | A talk that I'm not very fond of about why Node.js is a good technology to use.           | `grunt serve` |
| [css styling](css/)               | How to style your css to make me happy. Also some notes about sass.                       | `grunt serve` |
| [ECOMRS](ecomrs/)                 | One of my favorite talk! [Elegant Collection Operations with Map, Reduce and Select!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POSMbOWb-U&t=10m0s) | Uh... `cd the_real_talk` and `vim` around is probably your best bet |
| [Elixir talk](elixir-talk/)       | A basic talk on Elixir. Essentially just explained the code in the files.                 | `vim <files>` |
| [Weblog](weblog/)                 | Intro to Rails. One of my sassier talks.                                                  | `grunt serve` |
| [Sinatra](sinatra/)               | A dive into Sinatra's cooler features.                                                    | `grunt serve` |
| [Redis](redis/)                   | A introductory talk discussing some of Redis' features.                                   | `grunt serve` |
