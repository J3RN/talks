					<h1>The Right Tool for the Job</h1>
					<h3>Finding the right web technology for your project</h3>
					<p>
						<small>By Jonathan Arnett (J3RN)</small>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
          <h2>So you've got an idea</h2>
          <p>So the hard part is out of the way. Now you need to build it.</p>
          <br />
          <p>For that job, you'll need some talented developers. But what kind
          of developers should you be looking for? Rails engineers? Node
          experts? PHP professionals?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
          <h2>Once upon a time, there was PHP</h2>
          <img src="images/PHP-logo.svg" />
				</section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is a PHP?</h2>
          <p>PHP is an older language (first incarnation in 1994), but some
          important sites are have been written in it (Facebook, for instance).
          Is it right for your project?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>No.</h2>
          <p>PHP is complex, and takes a long time to learn and especially to
          master. While versatile, there are better options available.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Then, there was Ruby (and Rails)</h2>
          <img src="images/Ruby_on_Rails.svg" />
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>So what's a Ruby?</h2>
          <p>Ruby was released in 1995, and the Rails framework was released in
          2008.</p>
          <p>Several large sites were or are written in Ruby on Rails,
          including Twitter, Hulu, and Shopify. So is it right for your
          project?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Maybe!</h2>
          <p>Ruby on Rails is still used for many projects! It offers very
          rapid prototpying, and a shallow learning curve.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>However...</h2>
          <p>Twitter abandoned Ruby on Rails in 2008, citing scaling issues,
          and "rolled their own" Java framework, Blender.</p>
          <p>If you anticipate a high amount of traffic, Rails might not be for
          you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recently, there was Node.js</h2>
          <img src="images/nodejs-light.png" />
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Tell me about Node</h2>
          <p>Node is young, and was started in 2009. I mean, Ryan Dahl (the
          author) looks under 30 (but who knows, really?).</p>
          <p>Node has had some problems, but overall has matured to be a great
          platform. Walmart launched a middleware written in Node right before
          Black Friday... and their servers were "bored out of their minds".</p>
          <p>So is Node right for your project?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Probably!</h2>
          <p>Node is a top choice for writing modern web applications. Oh, and
          it also is very aware of mobile apps, too. You can just treat the
          website as just another app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>To Recap...</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">So, I should use PHP?
              <span class="fragment">NO.</span></li>
            <li class="fragment">If you want to be able to create quickly, but don't expect
              to scale (or are willing to port your application if you do),
              <span class="fragment">Rails might be for you.</span></li>
            <li class="fragment">If you want your site to be super fast, and
              expect to be linking up mobile apps, <span class="fragment">Node.js
              is probably for you.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
